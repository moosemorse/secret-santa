# 🎅🎅 Secret Santa Organizer 🎅🎅 

This project automates the traditional Secret Santa process by quickly assigning matches and sending emails to participants with the name of the person they’re gifting. The goal is to eliminate the delays of traditional methods and avoid the awkwardness of picking the same name twice. The organizer is also included in the process, ensuring no one is left out. It's an easy and efficient way to make Secret Santa more fun and hassle-free!
